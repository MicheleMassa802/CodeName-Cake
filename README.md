# CodeName-Cake
Order Management System mobile application meant to be user focused, with all of the code logic and collected data residing at the user’s device through local files.

In the future, I might consider taking portions of this project to global databases such that each user gets an account and some information is accessed through wifi with the respective API calls, but for now I want something that is quick, usable, and won’t get me broke for just a side project (considering the scale of storage that would be required for some of the features I want to offer).

Also, I didn't want to over complicate what I want to be one of my first continuously developed projects. I just want it to be painless as this app is meant to be used by my mom... and I kind of need to get it done quick before she uses one of the far better alternatives such as Notion (which I already recommended).<br>
